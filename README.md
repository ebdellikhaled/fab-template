fab-template
============

Application template for Firebase Angular Bootstrap (FAB) applications.

Use this template as the starting point for an application that will require users to register and login.

This uses Firebase, Angular and Bootstrap to create a FAB application that does not need a node-express server like a MEAN application would.
This demo app is a working skeleton that uses Firebase Simple Login to implement user registration etc...

How to Use It
===

1. Clone the files.
2. Edit **config.js** to point at your own firebase app.
3. Edit files **index.html**, **app.js** and files in the **/pages/app/** directory to create your Angular app.
