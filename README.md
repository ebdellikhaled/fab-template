fab-template
============

Application template for Firebase Angular Bootstrap (FAB) applications.

Use this template as the starting point for an application that will requires users to register and login.

I have used Firebase together with Angular and Bootstrap to create a FAB application. 
This demo app is a working skeleton that uses Firebase Simple Login to implement user registration etc...

How to Use It
===

Edit config.js to point at your own firebase app.
